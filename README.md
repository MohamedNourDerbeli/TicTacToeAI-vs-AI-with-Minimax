## How to Observe

Sit back and observe the AI players (Alex and Sam) compete against each other in a game of tic-tac-toe.

The game continues until one of the AI players wins, or it ends in a draw.

Enjoy observing the AI vs AI tic-tac-toe matches!

## Code Overview

- `tic_tac_toe.py`: The main Python script containing the game logic.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies

The code has no external dependencies beyond Python itself.

## Acknowledgments

This project showcases an AI vs AI tic-tac-toe simulation. Both AI players utilize the minimax algorithm to make strategic moves.
